#solarized-crosh

Google recently released "Secure Shell" On the chrome web store. It's an SSH
tool in your chrome browser. After I added it and I peek at the options on there
I see that I can add my own colors. So I downloaded my Solarized file and
hit "Restore Backup" Selected my file, and Bam. Solarized Secure Shell.
I realize though that Secure Shell is just like crosh. I press
"CTRL+ALT+T" to open up crosh and it was solarized as well.
