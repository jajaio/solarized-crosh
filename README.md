#Solarized crosh

Google recently released an SSH client called Secure Shell on the Chrome Webstore. After I added it, I had a peek at the Options menu and saw that you can change the colors, so I put in the solarized colors and exported a JSON file in Options>Save Backup. To use these settings go to Options>Restore Backup, select the file, and Bam. Solarized Secure Shell and crosh.
